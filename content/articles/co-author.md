## What is this

How many times have you been working on a piece of code with someone and then when committing you ask their full name and email address for adding a Co-author to the commit?

Upgrade to 21st century, use this plugin to automatically fetch author details from your commit history and then add to your commit message, all from inside neovim.

It shows you a list of all the unique authors in your current repo.

`co-author.nvim` automatically works with telescope and presents the list in a nice fuzzy searchable UI.
