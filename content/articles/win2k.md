Do you find the Windows dev environment lacking? Do you miss your precious CLI tools on Windows?

Well I felt the same way too. That's why I combined a package manager, a powerful CLI editor, tiling window management and lots of other tools in a easy to set up solution.

win2k is a set of handcrafted configs for setting up a complete dev environment on Windows.

It makes developing on Windows much more pleasant for CLI lovers.

## ‚ú® Features

- Can set up a complete dev environment within minutes
- Full featured CLI dev environment on Windows (natively, without WSL!)
- Powerful personalized editing with [nvim2k](https://github.com/2kabhishek/nvim2k)
- Shiny and extensible prompt with [oh-my-posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/) and [Posh2K](https://github.com/2kabhishek/Posh2K)
- Modern and intuitive keybindings for Windows Terminal inspired by [tmux-tilit](https://github.com/2kabhishek/tmux-tilit)
- Tiling window management with [komorebi](https://github.com/LGUG2Z/komorebi) and [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
- Statusbar support with [yasb](https://github.com/denBot/yasb)
- More!!

## Setup

### ‚ö° Requirements

- Powershell >= 7 (recommended), Most features should work on Powershell 1.0
- [scoop](https://scoop.sh/) ‚Äî for package management
- [Meslo Nerd Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/blob/master/patched-fonts/Meslo/S-DZ/Regular/complete/Meslo%20LG%20S%20DZ%20Regular%20Nerd%20Font%20Complete.ttf) ‚Äî Recommended font for glyphs support
- Git with SSH setup ‚Äî for cloning submodules, you can easily do this with the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) by running `gh auth login` and selecting SSH as protocol.

### üöÄ Installation

```ps1
# Install scoop
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser # Optional: Needed to run a remote script the first time
irm get.scoop.sh | iex

# Install git if you haven't already
scoop install git

git clone https://github.com/2kabhishek/win2k
cd win2k

.\setup.ps1
```

This will install all necessary packages, modules and setup symlinks for you.

### üíª Usage

#### Tiling

Tiling is disabled by default as AutoHotKey keybindings are somewhat buggy.

But if you want to use Tiling Window Manager without keybindings:

Run `StartTiling`/`StopTiling` on a Powershell prompt to control tiling.

I recommend using PowerTools to add some keybindings, for example:

- <kbd>Win</kbd> + <kbd>q</kbd> for closing current window

#### Status Bar

You can use yasb to show a status bar, similar to polybar.
Follow instructions on [yasb](https://github.com/denBot/yasb) to set up.

My yasb configs are [here](https://github.com/2KAbhishek/win2k/tree/main/config/yasb)

#### Extra Fonts

If you want to try out other fonts, you can also use oh-my-posh to install fonts

Just run `oh-my-posh font install` and select the font of your choice.

#### More Tools

I have intentionally kept the default list of packages to bare essentials.

If you want any other tools you can install them with scoop or winget.

```ps1
# Install VS Code
scoop install code
# Install winget
scoop install winget
```

You can also search for packages using `scoop search name`.

#### Other Configs

For most tools I'm symlinking configs over from my main [Dotfiles](https://github.com/2kabhishek/Dotfiles).

You can do the same or plugin your own.

## Behind The Code

### üåà Inspiration

I find working on Windows somewhat unpleasant, WSL although tries and fixes it, but it felt constrained.

That's why I decided to set up a dev environment using native windows tooling.

### üí° Challenges/Learnings

- The main challenge was to figure out all the pieces of this puzzle and solving it.
- Learned a lot about Powershell and did quite some scripting with it.
- Learned more about the Windows ecosystem, different environment variables, configs etc.
- Had lots of fun!
