I recently completed my Hacktoberfest PRs and
This post is for all the people who are struggling to get those Pull Requests in and have to resort to special repositories which are targeted toway Hacktoberfest only (nothing wrong with using these).

But there's another way with which you can make valuable contributions easily to the biggest of projects and later on, look at them and feel proud. 😄

## Documentation Matters

The secret I'm talking about is of documentation, most if not all repositories on GitHub use simple markdown files for their documentation, which are very easy to edit and append to. Most of the repositories out there could also use better documentation and the maintainers will be more than happy to accept your PRs.

## Translation Goes a Long Way

Another great thing you can do is provide translations for the documentation, which is easy enough for you to do if you are multilingual. By doing this not only you will get the PRs in but this will make the repository much more inclusive and this will make life a bit easier for many people who speak that language and use the project.

So, what are you waiting for, head on to GitHub and find all your favourite projects and start making those contributions.

Happy Open Sourcing. 🎉❤️🙏🏼
