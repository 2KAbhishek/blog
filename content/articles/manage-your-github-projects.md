Do you have a lot of repositories on GitHub and are always making changes to them?
Do you work on multiple machines, and are struggling to keep the repositories in sync?
Have you ever moved to a new machine and spent what seems like an eternity cloning all your projects one by one?

If your answer to any of these questions was yes, well I have a solution for you.

## Introducing [GHPM - GitHub Project Manager](https://github.com/2kabhishek/ghpm)

It is a utility to fix a few problems a developer faces while managing GitHub projects.

GHPM allows you to clone all the repositories in a user's GitHub profile, saving you lots of time.
All the repositories will be cloned in the current directory.

It lets you pull and push changes for all the git repositories in a directory, saving you lots of cd and git pull/push.

It also has a option to quickly change the remote repository protocol from https to ssh, so you don't have to manually use it.

You can find all the installation and usage information [here](https://github.com/2kabhishek/ghpm).
If you have any issues or requests feel free to create an issue over on GitHub, and if you have any contributions you are always welcome.

I hope this tool helps you to manage your GitHub projects as much as it helped me.
