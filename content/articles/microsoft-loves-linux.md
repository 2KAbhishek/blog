Any of you who use npm should have received a mail and that is the reason behind this post.

Microsoft has made a lot of progress in between Steve Ballmer's "Linux is a cancer" and Satya Nadella's "Microsoft ‚ô• Linux" in the Open Source world.
Most of what microsoft has been doing recently is very inclusive of OSS.

Things from the top of my head include WSL, VS Code, GitHub, Dot Net Core, Powershell and now npm and the list is [very long](opensource.microsoft.com).
Although one can argue that Microsoft is doing all this to push it's Azure platform but still getting quality cross platform open source software is always welcome.

Hopefully Microsoft will keep the ball rolling in the right direction and we'll hear more good news in the future. üòÑ
