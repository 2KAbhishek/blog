JavaScript is taking the world by storm, once used to add functionality to the web, now it is being used in almost all types of software development.

For example, Using JavaScript you can do things like build Progressive Web Apps (web apps with native app like features) , create desktop apps using electron, make Android & iOS apps with React Native, do server stuff using Node and Express and **many** more.

If that wasn't overwhelming and confusing enough,  there exists more flavours of JavaScript out there than you can count üòµ & what is JavaScript and what's not is a post for another time.

**So how do you get started with this interesting piece of technology?**

1Ô∏è‚É£ The first thing you should do is learn **Vanilla JS**. Strong fundamentals go a long way. I will suggest [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) a free course by Wes Bos, that focuses on Vanilla JS.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Next get familiar with **JSON** , which stands for Javascript Object Notation. It is mostly used for data storage and for passing data from one place to another e.g - a REST API call.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Next you should learn **Typescript** which is a strongly typed superset of Javascript. It tries to bring a little harmony to the chaotic world of Javascript.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Next you should get yourself acquainted with the node package manager or **npm** for short. It's a command line package manager for that helps you install various libraries and frameworks.

After learning all this you may now focus on what you want to make, look at the available tools, maybe a try a few of those and finally pick your tool for the trade. üòå

Hopefully, I was able to clear a few doubts with this post? ü§î
SCREAM! in the comments section (Yes, use all caps ü§£)  if you have any questions.
