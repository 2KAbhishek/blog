I was recently trying out OBS for my new [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTedGjRpeTc8NTbchraGIuw)! but faced weird flickering issues when recording, after a lot of tweaking I found the solution.

You have to turn of Vsync on your system.

On KDE the steps are as follows:

1. Open System Settings
2. Then go to Display and Monitor section
3. Click on Compositor
4. Here, change Tearing Prevention (vsync) to Never

This should do the trick.
Try again, and you shouldn't face flickering issues anymore.
