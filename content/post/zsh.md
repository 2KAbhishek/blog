I have been using zsh as my shell for over 6 years now.
During this time, I've experimented with various configurations and setups, and I've finally settled on one that I like.
In this post, I will discuss how I organize my zsh config and how you can do it too.

Let's get started.

## Config Structure

Before diving into the config files, let's examine the structure of my config directory:

```sh
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shell
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ aliases.sh
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ environment.sh
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ functions.sh
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ local.sh
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ zsh
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .zshenv
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .zshrc
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ aliases.zsh
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ completions.zsh
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ keys.zsh
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ omz.zsh
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ options.zsh
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ prompt
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ init.zsh
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ p10k.mise.zsh
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ p10k.zsh
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ powerlevel2k.zsh
```

Every file under the `shell` directory is a shared configuration file that is common across shells, while files in the `zsh` directory are zsh-specific configuration files.

### Config Location and [.zshenv](https://github.com/2KAbhishek/dots2k/blob/main/config/zsh/.zshenv)

I keep my zsh config in the `~/.config/zsh` directory to keep my home directory uncluttered.
To do this, set the `ZDOTDIR` environment variable to `~/.config/zsh` in the `~/.zshenv` file.

Similarly, I symlink my `~/.config/zsh/.zshenv` file to `~/.zshenv`, with the following contents:

```sh
ZDOTDIR="${${(%):-%x}:P:h}"
```

This sets the `ZDOTDIR` to the directory where the `.zshenv` file is present (`~/.config/zsh`).

### [.zshrc](https://github.com/2KAbhishek/dots2k/blob/main/config/zsh/.zshrc)

This is the entry point for my zsh config, which sources all the config files in a specific order.

```sh
# Load configs in specific order
source ~/.config/shell/environment.sh
source "$ZDOTDIR/prompt/init.zsh"
source "$ZDOTDIR/omz.zsh"
source "$ZDOTDIR/options.zsh"
source "$ZDOTDIR/completions.zsh"
source ~/.config/shell/functions.sh
source ~/.config/shell/aliases.sh
source "$ZDOTDIR/aliases.zsh"
source "$ZDOTDIR/keys.zsh"

# Load Local configuration if exists
[ -f ~/.config/shell/local.sh ] && source ~/.config/shell/local.sh
```

Let's now discuss the purpose of each file.
I will go through the files in order without delving too much into their contents.
You can click on the file name to view the details.

### [environment.sh](https://github.com/2KAbhishek/dots2k/blob/main/config/shell/environment.sh)

The first file loaded is the environment file, which contains environment variables and exports needed for the shell.
This includes the `PATH` and `EDITOR` configs along with other environment variables.
This is where you should add other enhancements to `PATH` like `~/.local/bin` or `brew` paths.

### [prompt/init.sh](https://github.com/2KAbhishek/dots2k/blob/main/config/zsh/prompt/init.sh)

The next file is the prompt initialization file, which loads the prompt theme [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) along with the instant prompt feature.
I also load my custom prompt theme [powerlevel2k](https://github.com/2KAbhishek/dots2k/blob/main/config/zsh/prompt/powerlevel2k.zsh) here.

### [omz.zsh](https://github.com/2KAbhishek/dots2k/blob/main/config/zsh/omz.zsh)

This script initializes [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) along with the plugins and themes I use.
To install Oh My Zsh, the custom plugins, and the theme, I use my [dots2k setup script](https://github.com/2KAbhishek/dots2k/blob/main/setup.sh#L72-L95).

If you do not want to use Oh My Zsh, you can skip this file and replace it with your own custom plugins and theme.

### [options.zsh](https://github.com/2KAbhishek/dots2k/blob/main/config/zsh/options.zsh)

This contains all the options used for zsh, like `setopt` and `unsetopt`, along with plugin-specific options.

### [completions.zsh](https://github.com/2KAbhishek/dots2k/blob/main/config/zsh/completions.zsh)

This file contains the completions setup for zsh, along with custom tool completions, like fzf.

### [functions.sh](https://github.com/2KAbhishek/dots2k/blob/main/config/shell/functions.sh)

This is where I define my common shell functions.

### [aliases.sh](https://github.com/2KAbhishek/dots2k/blob/main/config/shell/aliases.sh)

This is where I define my common shell aliases.

### [aliases.zsh](https://github.com/2KAbhishek/dots2k/blob/main/config/zsh/aliases.zsh)

I define zsh-specific aliases, primarily suffix and global aliases here.

### [keys.zsh](https://github.com/2KAbhishek/dots2k/blob/main/config/zsh/keys.zsh)

The last file is the keys file, which contains key bindings for zsh.
This file is last to allow it to override any key bindings set by plugins.

### local.sh

This is an optional file that I use to store local configurations specific to that machine or any one-off configurations.
This file is intentionally not checked into the repository.

## Conclusion

This setup provides a fast and modular shell experience, allowing easy addition or removal of features without cluttering the config.
I hope this post helps you organize your own zsh config.
