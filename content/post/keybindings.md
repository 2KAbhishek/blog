Keybindings or keyboard shortcuts are essential to a good workflow.
They help you navigate faster, be more productive and reduce the time you spend on repetitive tasks.

My workflow is heavily keyboard driven and primmarily relies on a browser and a terminal for which I use my own set of keybindings.

Recently, I realized that a lot of this information is scattered and I have to keep looking up the keybindings over the internet / my configuration files.

From there I decided to go on a journey of documenting all the keyboard shortcuts I use everyday!

Here's all that I covered:

- [MacOS](#macos)
- [Raycast](#raycast)
- Aerospace (Window Tiling)
- Alacritty (Terminal)
- Tmux (with tilit)
- Shell
- Zsh
- Neovim (Editor)
- Arc Browser
- Vimium
- Qutebrowser (Alternate Browser)

## MacOS

> Full Disclosure: Although my heart lies with Linux, I have been using a Mac for work for past few months.

I don't change / use a lot of the default keybindings on MacOS at a system level.

I remap the `Caps Lock` key to `Escape` (neovim btw!) and Swap `Fn` and `Ctrl` keys.
Other than that, I have few mappings for screenshots and mission control.
