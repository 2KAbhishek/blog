# Assume Positive Intent and Build Trust

As we continue working closely with clients, we often find ourselves in situations where we make recommendations that we believe to be in the best interest of the project.
However, it's not uncommon to face pushbacks.
When this happens, it's crucial to **"Assume Positive Intent."** This mindset is essential in navigating these challenges effectively.

## Why Assume Positive Intent?

When someone pushes back against an idea or suggestion, it's easy to misinterpret their actions as being driven by personal motives like spite or a lack of trust.
However, it's far more productive to assume that they are not acting out of negativity.
The person pushing back could be influenced by several factors:

1. **Historical Reasons**:
   They may have been burned by similar decisions in the past and carry that caution forward.
2. **Perceived Risks**:
   They might see risks that we haven't considered or feel that the proposed solution is too risky given the current context.
3. **Different Perspectives**:
   They may have a different understanding of the problem or constraints based on their experiences.

By assuming positive intent, we approach the conversation with empathy and openness, making it easier to understand their concerns and build constructive dialogue.

## Building Trust Through Understanding

It's important to recognize that, just like us, our clients and stakeholders are also striving for the best outcomes for the team and the product.
Rather than dismissing their feedback, we should take the opportunity to understand their perspective better.

A few steps to consider:

1. **Listen Actively**:
   Pay attention to their concerns without interrupting or immediately countering. This demonstrates respect and a willingness to understand.
2. **Ask Clarifying Questions**:
   Instead of assuming we know why theyâ€™re pushing back, ask questions to uncover the underlying reasons. For example, "Can you help me understand the concerns you have with this approach?"
3. **Share Your Reasoning**:
   Be transparent about why you believe your recommendation is beneficial. Share the thought process, data, or past experiences that led to your conclusion.
4. **Find Common Ground**:
   Look for areas where both parties agree and build on those. This can help in creating a sense of shared purpose and collaboration.

## "Give Away Control to Have Control"

In our roles, it's essential to remember that sometimes we need to **"give away control to have control."**
This means understanding when to let go of our need to drive every decision.
If a client or stakeholder has strong feelings against a particular approach, it might be more valuable in the long run to concede and support their direction.

By doing so, we build trust and demonstrate that we are flexible and committed to collaboration rather than rigid in our thinking.
Trust is not built through one-off wins; it's built through consistent, meaningful contributions over time.

## Conclusion

By assuming positive intent and being open to different perspectives, we create an environment of trust and collaboration.
Keeping this principles in mind can help you foster a foundation of trust and mutual respect with your clients, leading to better outcomes for everyone.
