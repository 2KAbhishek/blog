I recently did this with lazygit, a terminal-based git client I use every day. I wanted to add co-authors to commits, which is handy for pair programming at Incubyte
My pull request for this feature got merged recently, and now I&amp;rsquo;m thrilled to use it with the latest release!</description></item><item><title>Links - Present Your Links In Style 🔗🔮</title><link>https://2kabhishek.github.io/blog/2022/08/links-present-your-links-in-style/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Aug 2022 10:36:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://2kabhishek.github.io/blog/2022/08/links-present-your-links-in-style/</guid><description>Have you ever wanted a place that can make all your profiles and links nicely organized, easily searchable and with super customizability?

But there&amp;rsquo;s another way with which you can make valuable contributions easily to the biggest of projects and later on, look at them and feel proud. 😄
Documentation Matters The secret I&amp;rsquo;m talking about is of documentation, most if not all repositories on GitHub use simple markdown files for their documentation, which are very easy to edit and append to.</description></item><item><title>My Intro To Github Actions ⚙️🤷</title><link>https://2kabhishek.github.io/blog/2020/09/my-intro-to-github-actions-%EF%B8%8F/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://2kabhishek.github.io/blog/2020/09/my-intro-to-github-actions-%EF%B8%8F/</guid><description>GitHub actions are something that I was always curious about but never really explored, thanks to this hackathon I took a dive and was able to come up with something that actually solves one of my problems.
Gulp Runner Like many of us, I have a personal site deployed on GitHub Pages. 🌐
It uses SCSS so I have to convert it to CSS pre-deployment, I also like to have my scripts and styles minified.</description></item><item><title>Manage GitHub Projects Easily ♻📂</title><link>https://2kabhishek.github.io/blog/2020/06/manage-github-projects-easily/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://2kabhishek.github.io/blog/2020/06/manage-github-projects-easily/</guid><description>Do you have a lot of repositories on GitHub and are always making changes to them? Do you work on multiple machines, and are struggling to keep the repositories in sync? Have you ever moved to a new machine and spent what seems like an eternity cloning all your projects one by one?
If your answer to any of these questions was yes, well I have a solution for you.</description></item><item><title>Sync Forked Repository With Upstream 🔁✔️</title><link>https://2kabhishek.github.io/blog/2020/06/sync-forked-repository-with-upstream-%EF%B8%8F/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jun 2020 13:24:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://2kabhishek.github.io/blog/2020/06/sync-forked-repository-with-upstream-%EF%B8%8F/</guid><description>Here&amp;rsquo;s the situation, You have forked a repository on GitHub, you have made your changes and sent a pull request, and that request has been merged.
Now you want to make further changes, but the repository mentions that you are X commits ahead or/and X commits behind upstream repository.
So how do you sync it?
You can delete your fork and fork the original repository again, but that is a very tedious thing to do.</description></item><item><title>Trim Unnecessary Files From Git History ✂️🗃️</title><link>https://2kabhishek.github.io/blog/2019/08/trim-unnecessary-files-from-git-history-%EF%B8%8F%EF%B8%8F/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Aug 2019 18:28:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://2kabhishek.github.io/blog/2019/08/trim-unnecessary-files-from-git-history-%EF%B8%8F%EF%B8%8F/</guid><description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a common scenario, You have committed a file to your git repo and have also pushed to remote.
The file wasn&amp;rsquo;t supposed to be there, maybe it was something you forgot to mention in your gitignore or something that was supposed to be an environment variable, or maybe it was a binary not related to the project at all ( Cat GIFs? 😉).
This not only raises some security concerns but also drives the size of your repository up and simply deleting the file won&amp;rsquo;t fix the problem.</description></item></channel></rss>
