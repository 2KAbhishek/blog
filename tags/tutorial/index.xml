Details: So, I recently installed MariaDB (Community fork of MySQL) on my Manjaro system and when I started the system with:
sudo systemctl start mysqld

The file wasn&amp;rsquo;t supposed to be there, maybe it was something you forgot to mention in your gitignore or something that was supposed to be an environment variable, or maybe it was a binary not related to the project at all ( Cat GIFs? üòâ).
This not only raises some security concerns but also drives the size of your repository up and simply deleting the file won&amp;rsquo;t fix the problem.</description></item></channel></rss>
