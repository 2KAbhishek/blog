Long delays in code reviews can cause several issues:
Slower Delivery Pipeline üê¢
When reviews are delayed, the overall progress of the project is hindered, affecting delivery timelines.
Idle Time and Context Switching ü¶•
Developers either move on to new tasks or, worse, sit idle waiting for reviews.</description></item><item><title>Keybindings FTW! ‚å®Ô∏èü•Ç</title><link>https://2kabhishek.github.io/blog/keybindings/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2kabhishek.github.io/blog/keybindings/</guid><description>Keybindings or keyboard shortcuts are essential to an efficient workflow. They help you navigate faster, be more productive and reduce the time you spend on repetitive tasks.
My workflow is heavily keyboard driven and primmarily relies on a browser and a terminal within a tiling window manager, for these I use my own set of keybindings. Because I work on multiple machines and operating systems, I have to keep track of all the keybindings I use and make sure they are somewhat consistent across all the systems and tools.</description></item></channel></rss>
