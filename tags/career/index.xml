&lt;p>While civil architects design awe-inspiring structures that stand the test of time, software architects craft intricate architectures that form the foundation of modern technology. Software architects mold the digital landscape as we know it.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Sure, I agree, we all want fast software. 🚀&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s the thing though,
One can build fast and robust software without spending 1000 hours on Data Structure and Algorithms. ✨&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Believing that crazy DSA skills are needed for optimizing software is just not right, any good developer will look at 20 other things before even thinking about runtime complexity.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
